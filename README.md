# EMERGE Demo: Soft Sensor Touch Detection

This repository demonstrates the use of soft sensors for touch detection. The system consists of two main components: the **Follow-Touch** application for managing BLE connections and measurements, and a **Neural Model** based on Randomized Oscillator Networks for detecting one of five contact points on the soft sensor.

## Follow-Touch: Bluetooth-Based Sensor Management

The **Follow-Touch** application acts as the central hub for connecting to and managing BLE-enabled peripherals. It provides a graphical interface for scanning, pairing, and interacting with sensors.

### Features
- **Device Scanning and Pairing**: Automatically scans for BLE devices and allows pairing with peripherals.
- **Real-Time Measurements**: Collects sensor data at configurable intervals (55ms to 1000ms).
- **File Output**: Saves measurement data in JSON format for each peripheral and combines results into an Excel file (.xls).
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays the connection state of peripherals using color codes:
  - **White**: Undefined state
  - **Green**: Bluetooth connection is working
  - **Orange**: Request for pairing
  - **Red**: No Bluetooth connection
- **Plotting**: Each peripheral has its own plot window to visualize sensor data in real-time.

### Default Behavior
- Only peripherals with the name "touch" are visible by default.
- Output files are saved in the `STORAGE_PATH` directory, which can be configured via environment variables.

## Neural Model: Randomized Oscillator Networks

The **Neural Model** uses Randomized Oscillator Networks as a recurrent model to detect one of five contact points on the soft sensor. This model processes the sensor data collected by the Follow-Touch application and predicts the contact point based on the input signals.

### Features
- **Recurrent Neural Network**: Implements a Randomized Oscillator Network for temporal data processing.
- **Contact Point Detection**: Identifies one of five predefined contact points on the soft sensor.
- **Integration with Follow-Touch**: Processes the JSON output files generated by the Follow-Touch application.
